# 🎥 Object Detection & Tracking in Video Pipeline

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning pipeline designed to ingest raw video feeds, detect and track specific objects, and export the tracking data into structured CSV reports. Built using the state-of-the-art YOLO11 architecture and ByteTrack algorithms, this project demonstrates how to transform unstructured computer vision data into actionable, quantifiable metrics suitable for enterprise reporting and analytics.

---
## 🎯 Key Objectives
- Detect objects from video frames
- Track objects across frames using unique IDs
- Count objects without duplication
- Export results into structured data formats

---
## 🧠 Core Features

### 🔹 Object Detection (YOLO11)
- Uses Ultralytics YOLO11m
- Trained on COCO (80 classes)
- Configuration:
 - Epochs: 100
 - Batch Size: 16
 - Image Size: 640
---
### 🔹 Multi-Object Tracking (ByteTrack)
- Maintains persistent tracking IDs
- Prevents:
 - Double counting
 - Frame-to-frame inconsistency
---
### 🔹 ROI-Based Counting System
- Defines a dynamic counting zone
- Counts objects only when entering the region
- Ensures accurate event-based counting

```python
if zone_x1 < cx < zone_x2 and zone_y1 < cy < zone_y2:
    if track_id not in counted_ids:
        counted_ids.add(track_id)
```
---
### 🔹 Automated Data Export
- Generates structured output:
```bash
total_counts.csv
```
Example:
```bash
| Object Type | Total Count |
|------------|------------|
| Person     | 32         |
| Car        | 18         |
| Dog        | 5          |
```
---
### 🔹 Video Annotation & Export
- Annotates:
  - Bounding boxes
  - Class labels
  - Tracking IDs
  - Counting zone
- Converts output to web-ready MP4 using FFmpeg
